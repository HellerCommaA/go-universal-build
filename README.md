# Go Universal Build System
This is a universal `build` system powered by Go Lang.  
All things considered, it's an expirement by me to further my knowledge of Go and building a semi-large-scale-system in the language.  

The intent is that you can pass a `build.json` file along to the compiled executable to build your multiple projects simultaneiously and have them output to a common directory.  

This started as an idea I had while trying to come up with something for work to compile a C#, C++, and multiple Java projects to a common directory.  I figured, I may as well try Go over a hacky-Bash script.
